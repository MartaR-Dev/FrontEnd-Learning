# freeCodeCamp Learning Projects
In this folder you will find my most relevant projects created while learning Front End Development through freeCodeCamp. This is where I started my learning journey, therefore, my very first projects as well.
The certification followed was ***Responsive Web Design***.

## Languages and Frameworks
Since this was the beginning of my journey, it also meant learning the base languages of Web Development:
* HTML
* CSS
