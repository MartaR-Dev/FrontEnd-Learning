# Front End Learning Journey
This repository is divided in two major folders:
* freeCodeCamp
* Codecademy

In each, you will find the most relevant work I did during my learning for the Front End Developer path. These projects are mainly from self-learning. I got the opportunity to follow most of the Front End career path in Codecademy through my "traineeship" at DTACT, which gave me great knowledge to start my work journey as a Front End Developer.

## Languages and Frameworks
You will find the following languages and frameworks in those projects:
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* React
* Redux
* Bootstrap
